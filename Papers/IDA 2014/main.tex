\begin{abstract}
	Physiology experts deal with complex biophysical relationships, across multiple spatial
	and temporal scales. Automating the discovery of such relationships, in terms of
	physiological meaning, is a key goal to the physiology community. ApiNATOMY is an effort
	to provide an interface between the physiology expert's knowledge and all ranges of data
	relevant to physiology. It does this through an intuitive graphical interface for managing
	semantic metadata and ontologies relevant to physiology. In this paper, we present a
	web-based ApiNATOMY environment, allowing physiology experts to navigate through circuitboard
	visualizations of body components, and their cardiovascular and neural connections,
	across different scales.
	%%%% (MH: ambiguous)
	%Our tool prototype
	%shows ontology-based body parts and their cardiovascular and neural connections.
	%%
	Overlaid on these schematics are graphical renderings of organs, neurons and gene products,
	as well as mathematical models of processes semantically annotated with this knowledge.
	%%
	%%%% (MH: long and vague; perhaps rewrite?)
	%The tool
	%allows a physiology expert to visualize the anatomical context of physiological processes
	%of communication between body parts and substances located in body regions in support of
	%multiscale description of physiology processes.
